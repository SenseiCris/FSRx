## Notes

* To clone this in one pass, you must issue this command to clone submodules as well:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mkheck/FSRx
```

* If you've already cloned the project & missed picking up the submodules, simply run this to set it right:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

* Note that you can still clone all projects independently by following the links above to each individual repo
